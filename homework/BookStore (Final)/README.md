## 1. 描述網站的功能 Website's Function
This is an online book store website with POS system. There are two accounts that have been made, user account and admin account. To login as user or admin you can fill the data like this:
> USER
> * username : user
> * password : user

> ADMIN
> * username : admin
> * password : admin

If you want to use your own account to log in you can create one and login with your new account

### a. User can access pages as I mentions below :
### 1. Home
> In this pages the user can see a short description about the book store and the latest news about the store
### 2. Shop
> User can see the product description and add it to the shopping cart
### 3. About Us
> The user can get some information about the offline store location and the contact of the owner
### 4. Shopping Cart
> Here the user can see the books that have been added. User could remove it from the cart by click the x button and checkout to order the books. After click checkout, the cart would be empty and the order would be sent to the admin. After sent the order, the user still can order again and again.
### 5. FAQ (Frequently Ask Questions)

### b. And if you log in as admin you can access some pages differently :
### 1. Home
### 2. Shop
> In this page the admin can set the new price and new stock for the book. Just click on set price & stock, and then click right on the price and type the new price and change the stock. Finaly click the set price & stock button in the box, there would be an alert if the change that you made was succeed.
### 3. About Us
