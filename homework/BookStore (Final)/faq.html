                        Hello yellow chicken, I would like to ask. I have order some books from about a month ago.
                        But why up until now I haven't receive my books yet?

                    <td>
                        Ofcourse you wouldn't receive it since I just make this website for my 期末作業.
                        As long as you can login and order something and the admin can see your order, my job has done here.

                        Hmm, okay(?) next question, how long it takes you to finish this website?

                        Why you named this website as 306's book store?

                    <td>
                        Because majority I got the books from 306 room in my faculty so I named my store as 306's Book Store. 
                        You could come to this room to see our books collection, just need to knock the door and if you're lucky enough 
                        the door would be opened for you. :)

                        I've check the other online book store websites and their books is far cheaper than yours.
                        I think your books is too expensive.

                        Heeii, that's not a question..
                        And actually It's cheaper than the actual price that I paid to buy those books .-.
                        Just kidding, I forget how much I've paid for those books.

                        Easy! you just need to log out from your current account and fill the username as "admin",
                        the password is "admin". It's case sensitive, so pay attention for the upper case and lower case. 
                        Last just click the log in button.

                    <td>
                        Okay, I've log in as an admin now. But why I can't add more books to be sold on the website?

                        Since those small chicken have fleed away, I'm here to answer your question. 
                        You couldn't add any new book because right now this website doesn't have those kind of function.
                        You want to know why? I'll try to explain it. This website only used localStorage to store the data. 
                        The size of localStorage is varied depend on the browser that you use. But as I know it's just up until
                        3, 5, or maybe 10 MB. It's so small right? If the data was too big there's a chance to be overflow.
